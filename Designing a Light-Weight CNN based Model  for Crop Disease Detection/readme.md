These are the codes for model training. 1.train_cnn.py for CNN Model Training. 2.train_v3.py for MobileNetV3 Model Training. 3. ModifiedV3.py for our Model Training. 4.ModifiedV3.pth is for our trained Model. 5. mobilenetv3_GSD_small_plant_disease.pth is for our trained Model.

Model Training Files
This project includes the following code files and trained models:

train_cnn.py - Code for training a CNN model.
train_v3.py - Code for training a MobileNetV3 model.
ModifiedV3.py - Code for training our custom lightweight model based on MobileNetV3.
ModifiedV3.pth - Trained weights for our custom model.
mobilenetv3_GSD_small_plant_disease.pth - Trained weights for the MobileNetV3 model tailored for plant disease detection.
