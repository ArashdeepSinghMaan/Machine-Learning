## Project Overview

Our lightweight model is designed to offer **on-field disease detection**, improving both accessibility and efficiency for agricultural applications. This model is a **neural network inspired by the MobileNetV3 architecture** and is specifically tailored for **resource-constrained environments** such as mobile and edge devices.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset).


## Model Training Codes and Files(available under models folder)

Below are the codes and trained models used for training and evaluation:

1. **`train_cnn.py`** - Code for training the CNN model.
2. **`train_v3.py`** - Code for training the MobileNetV3 model.
3. **`ModifiedV3.py`** - Code for training our custom model.
4. **`ModifiedV3.pth`** - Trained model file for our custom model.
5. **`mobilenetv3_GSD_small_plant_disease.pth`** - Trained model file for MobileNetV3-based model.
