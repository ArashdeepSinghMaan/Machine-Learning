In this project we have trained a light-weight yet accurate model based on MobileNetV3 architecture to deploy on edge devices.
The Models folder has code to create and train models. Also it has trained models saved.
The performance folder has .json files having performance parameters of models.
The Images folder has inference results.
The test folder has codes to load and infering results from models.

We have used Pytorch and python throughout the project.

# Plant Disease Detection with Lightweight MobileNetV3 Model

This project aims to detect plant diseases using a lightweight, accurate neural network model based on the MobileNetV3 architecture. The model is optimized for deployment on edge devices.

## Project Structure

- **Models**: Contains the code to create and train models, along with pre-trained model files.
- **Performance**: Holds JSON files with performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, inference time) for each trained model.
- **Images**: Contains sample inference results, showing the model's predictions on test images.
- **Test**: Includes code to load and infer results from saved models.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- **Language**: Python

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing can be found on Kaggle:
