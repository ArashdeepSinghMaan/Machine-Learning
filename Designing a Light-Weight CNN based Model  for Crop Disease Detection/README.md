# Plant Disease Detection with Lightweight MobileNetV3 Model

This project aims to detect plant diseases using a lightweight, accurate neural network model based on the MobileNetV3 architecture. The model is optimized for deployment on edge devices.

## Project Structure

- **Models**: Contains the code to create and train models, along with pre-trained model files.
- **Performance**: Holds JSON files with performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, inference time) for each trained model.
- **Images**: Contains sample inference results, showing the model's predictions on test images.
- **Test**: Includes code to load and infer results from saved models.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- **Language**: Python

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing can be found on Kaggle:
