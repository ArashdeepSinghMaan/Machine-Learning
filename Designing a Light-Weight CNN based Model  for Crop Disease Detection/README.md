In this project we have trained a light-weight yet accurate model based on MobileNetV3 architecture to deploy on edge devices.
1.train_cnn.py trains a classical CNN Model for Crop Disease Detection
2.             a pure MobileNetV3 Model 
3. Our Model 

We have used Pytorch and python throughout the project.
